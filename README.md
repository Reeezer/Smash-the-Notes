# Smash The Notes

Smash The Notes is an exciting rhythm game that draws inspiration from popular titles like MuseDash and Osu!Taiko. The game offers an immersive experience where players must synchronize their actions with the rhythm of the music to hit incoming notes.

The main objective of this project is to provide an engaging gameplay experience that combines music and fast-paced gameplay. Players are challenged to hit notes that appear on the screen in time with the music.

The gameplay mechanics involve tapping, swiping, or holding down notes as they approach a designated area on the screen, following the beat of the music.
